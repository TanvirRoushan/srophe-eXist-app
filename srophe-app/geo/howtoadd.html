                    <p>Thank you for your interest in improving the Syriac Gazetteer!  The Syriac Gazetteer belongs to the community of users, and all users 
                        benefit from the additional information submitted by others.  There are several ways to add data to the Gazetteer:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="#mistake">Notify us of a mistake</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#existing">Add data to an existing entry</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#new">Create a new entry</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#spreadsheet">Contribute data pertaining to several records simultaneously</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>In each case, you will be asked to submit information using a web form and specifying the sources for the information.  Your submission
                        will then be sent to an editor for review, because Syriaca.org is committed to maintaining the highest standards of scholarly integrity.
                        Complete information in your submission (including full citations of relevant sources and your contact information for any follow-up
                        questions) will expedite the editorial process, although the editorsâ€™ work is on a volunteer basis and has no fixed timeline.  Failure to
                        include complete citations may result in editors choosing not to approve a submission.  When the editor approves a submission, it
                        becomes part of the Gazetteer citing your intervention.  In order to contribute, we ask you to submit new data under a 
                        <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a> 
                        (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>), the same license under which
                        the entire Syriac Gazetteer is published, so that your contribution can be included in the relevant entries.</p>
                    
                    <h2><a id="mistake" class="anchor">Notify us of a mistake</a></h2>
                    <p>Using the following link, please inform us which page URI the mistake is on, where on the page the mistake occurs, and a citation for the
                        correct information (except in the case of obviously misspelled words).  Please also include your email address, so that we can follow up
                        with you regarding anything which is unclear.  The form to notify us of an error is <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h2><a id="existing" class="anchor">Add data to an existing entry</a></h2>
                    <p>If there is information which you would like to add to an existing place entry in the Syriac Gazetteer, please use the link below to inform
                        us about the information, your (primary or scholarly) source for the information, and your contact information so that we can credit you for
                        the modification.  For categories of information which the Syriac Gazetteer structure can support, please see the section headings on the
                        entry for <a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</a> and specify in your submission which category or categories this new
                        information falls into.  At present this information should be entered into the email form <a href="#">here</a>, although there is an
                        additional delay in this process as the data needs to be encoded in the appropriate structured data format and assigned a URI.  A
                        structured form for submitting new entries is under development.</p>
                    
                    <h2><a id="new" class="anchor">Create a new entry</a></h2>
                    <p>If there is a place which is relevant to Syriac Studies but does not yet have an entry in the Syriac Gazetteer, please let us know.  Please
                        use the following link to inform us what you know about the place in question, including full citations to the source of the information.  At a
                        bare minimum, a place record can be created for a place based on a name (in English or Syriac), a source using that name (whether a
                        primary source or a work of scholarship), and a <a href="http://syriaca.org/documentation/place-types.html">place type</a>.  Your name
                        is also necessary in order to credit you as the creator of the entry.  Additional information would also be useful, such as additional names, 
                        location (in prose or coordinates), attestations in primary sources, known religious communities, links to other projects, etc., but it is
                        important that every individual statement have a citation to a primary or scholarly source.  At present this information should be entered
                        into the email form <a href="#">here</a>, although there is an additional delay in this process as the data needs to be encoded in the
                        appropriate structured data format and assigned a URI.  A structured form for submitting new entries is under development.</p>
                    
                    <h2><a id="spreadsheet" class="anchor">Contribute data pertaining to several records simultaneously</a></h2>
                    <p>The editors welcome the sharing of new datasets with information about several Gazetteer entries or new records to be created.  Since
                        each case is unique, it is best to contact the general editors in order to discuss the format your data is currently in and how best to share
                        that data with the Gazetteer.</p>
